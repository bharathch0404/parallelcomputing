These files consist of different Algorithms for Matrix Multiplication. 
The algorithms used are Brute Force, Divide and Conquer and Strassen's.
I parallelized Strassen and Divide and Conquer Algorithms.
Non Parallel Divide and Conquer's running time was 2.4 times more than Parallel Divide and Conquer.
Non Parallel Strassen's Algorithm's running time was 1.3 times more than Parallel one.
To run any of these files you need to have Java 7 and more.
To compile: 
  javac filename.java
To run:
  java filename
I have considered that the number or rows and columns in the array is power of 2.
I have included few test files and output files.
to run the testfiles:
  java filename < testfile1.txt > output1.txt

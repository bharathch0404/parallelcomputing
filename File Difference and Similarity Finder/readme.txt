#File Differentiator and Similarity Finder
This progamam has been written in C++ to find line by line differences and similarities between two files.
Contents-
finderusingdeque.cpp - A C++ implementation implemented using Deque - fastest in this folder
finderusinglist.cpp - A C++ implementation implemented using List - Second fastest in this folder
finderusingvector.cpp - A C++ implementation implemented using Vector - Slowest among the sequential algorithms
parallelusingdivideandconquerfinderusingvector.cpp - A C++ divide and conquer implementation implemented using Vector - changes will be made to this file to near future
parallelattempttwo.cpp - Tried to parallelize even more!

To run:
Compile the program using:
g++ filename.cpp -o filename
To run:
<executable> <file1> <file2>
